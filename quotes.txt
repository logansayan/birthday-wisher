Congratulations on another year on Earth.
There's something in the air today... I think it's an old fart.

Have a great birthday, and remember to never act your age.

Getting older sucks, but you make it look easy.
You make life more fun for everyone you meet. Thanks for being you.
You do so much for others, I hope you find time to do something for yourself on your birthday.
